# Why I love yoyos

Probably one of my more _uncommon interests_... I got into yoyo-ing in 7th grade after watching a video of a pro on youtube. Afterwards I bought a proffessional yoyo and started learning on youtube. Using an un-responsive yoyo is much more difficult than people imagine and it is a very intense workout at times. Since many people only imagine a standard yoyo when I talk about yoyo-ing I usually show them my yoyo and some tricks, or a video. Below is a video of a proffessional that I am very comparable with.

The first yoyo I got was a Duncan Barracuda, it is an aluminum unresponsive yoyo and I got it in Universal Studios in Orlando FL. Below is an image of the yoyo
