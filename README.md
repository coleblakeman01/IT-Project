# Final Project

# Cole Blakeman

This is my final GIT Hub project. To demonstrate what I have learned I will be typing in bold and italicized font. I will also upload images, links, and links in between pages locally.

# About me

I am from originally from Texas and I moved to Missouri to attend Mizzou. I really enjoy it here and the community and people are very nice.
