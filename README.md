This is my final GIT Hub project. To demonstrate what I have learned I will be typing in bold and italicized font. I will also upload images, links, and links in between pages locally.

# About me

I am from originally from Texas and I moved to Missouri to attend Mizzou. I really enjoy it here and the community and people are very nice. 

<a href="https://hackthebox.eu">HackTheBox</a> is intended for pentesters already familiar with cybersecurity. It has many fun and instructive challenges that can be learned a lot from. It typically involves black-box penetration testing environments. I higly encourage you to read my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/HackTheBox">HackTheBox writeups</a>!

# Interests

I enjoy going hiking, fishing, and playing <i> chess </i>.

<a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> tends to have easier challenges than HackTheBox, but sometimes there are boxes that can prove to be a real challenge. In any case, there is a lot to learn from this website, and I encourage you to try it out. Come check out my <a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/Writeups/TryHackMe">TryHackMe writeups</a>!
