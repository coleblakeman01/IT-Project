I originally came to Mizzou for the chess team. There were other teams to choose from, but Mizzou stood out because they are so strong. Having the opportunity to study with players signfiicantly better than me has help me improve a lot. I have also met most my friends from the chess team, everyone is from different countries and it makes it much more unique to learn about everyones story. Below is an image of the chess team
