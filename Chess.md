# Cole Blakeman's Chess Background

One of my hobbies is playing chess, I have been playing since I was 7 years old. 
My current title is Rated Expert / Candidate Master, below is a link to my United States Chess Federation _(USCF)_ page

## I originally came to _Mizzou_ for the chess team. There were other teams to choose from, but Mizzou stood out because they are so strong. Having the opportunity to study with players signfiicantly better than me has help me improve a lot. I have also met most my friends from the chess team, everyone is from different countries and it makes it much more unique to learn about everyones story. Below is an image of the chess team

Over the years I have won a few titles, here is a list of them

3. Rated Expert Title
4. Class A Title
5. Candidate Master Title

### I find chess very satisfying and it gives me something to work on with my spare time. While I dont study as much as I used to, I still find time every day to study for a short while. Below is an image of a book that I greatly enjoyed reading.
