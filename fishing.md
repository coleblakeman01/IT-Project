# About my fishing addiction

My dad first took me fishing when I was probably three or four, we went to a pond behind the campground we where staying at on Colorado. I absolutely loved everything about it, when I came back home to Texas I continued going fishing every day. For most of my life since then I'v gone fishing every day, it wasn't till college that I finally had a break. In my high school years I went out on bass boats and competed in THSBA, ( Texas High School Bass Association)
