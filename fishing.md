# About my fishing addiction

My dad first took me fishing when I was probably three or four, we went to a pond behind the campground we where staying at on Colorado. I absolutely loved everything about it, when I came back home to Texas I continued going fishing every day. For most of my life since then I'v gone fishing every day, it wasn't till college that I finally had a break. In my high school years I went out on bass boats and competed in THSBA, _(Texas High School Bass Association)_

THSBA is an orginization that allows high school bass fisherman to win college scholarships. Most fisherman come from country backgrounds with poor education so THSBA does a very good job giving those kids an opportunity. Below is the link to THSBA's website

Some of the lakes that THSBA fishes include,

1. Lake Lewisville
2. Lake Ray Roberts
3. Lake Grapevine
4. Lake Fork
5. Lake Tawakoni
6. Lake Palestine
7. Lake Texoma

Texoma is probably my favorite lake, I enjoy it because it is one of the few Texas Fisheries that has small mouth bass. While I usually end up catching a few smallmouth every trip they are still very fun. Below is a picture of a smallmouth
