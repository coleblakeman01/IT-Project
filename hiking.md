# What hiking is for me

I never get to go hiking often but it is one of my favorite things to do. Being able to experience the great outdoors in different settings and countries is always amazing. In most states I travel to I find time to take a hike. Hiking in the mountains is the most fun for me, I find it rather boring to walk in a straight line for hours, so mountains provide some more interesting pathways. Below is a picture of one of my favorite trails, it was in _Denali National Park._
