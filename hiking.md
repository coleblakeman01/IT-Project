# What hiking is for me

I never get to go hiking often but it is one of my favorite things to do. Being able to experience the great outdoors in different settings and countries is always amazing. In most states I travel to I find time to take a hike. Hiking in the mountains is the most fun for me, I find it rather boring to walk in a straight line for hours, so mountains provide some more interesting pathways. Below is a picture of one of my favorite trails, it was in _Denali National Park._ .

The following states or parks had some of my favorite trails

1. Yellowstone
2. North Dakota
3. Mount Rushmore
4. The Badlands
5. Denali

Spotting wildlife is also one of my favorite parts about being outside. Flowers, insects, and animals are always fun to look at for. When I go hiking I like to bring my camera and take photos of the things I find. Below is a photo of a fly I saw last time I went hiking in Columbia.
