# Coding

I started learning how to code this summer before I came to Mizzou. I used an online course called The Odin Project. It taught me HTML, and CSS. I didn't get much furhter because I became pretty busy before school started. However, I was happy that I learned both of those things because it was essential to my IT classes this year. Below is a link and image to the Odin Project.

Since starting in IT this year in college I have enjoyed it a lot. It has been a bit difficult for me because I work two jobs and I was involved in a few other classes and extra curriculars. However IT was my favorite class even though the work was a bit time consuming. I hope that next year I can put even more time into it and learn even more. Below is a list of all the things I have learned

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Java
4. JavaScript
5. Python
6. Markdown

I hope to continue to grow this list and improve in all the languages I have learned. Web Development interests me the most and I feel that the languages I am learning now will most definitly help me. Below is an image of the Python logo. Python is by far my favorite language that I know enough about. My IT 1040 class showed me the basics and I love it.
