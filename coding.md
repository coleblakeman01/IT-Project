# Coding

I started learning how to code this summer before I came to Mizzou. I used an online course called The Odin Project. It taught me HTML, and CSS. I didn't get much furhter because I became pretty busy before school started. However, I was happy that I learned both of those things because it was essential to my IT classes this year. Below is a link and image to the Odin Project.
