        <h1>Cole Blakeman's Info Site</h1>
        My name is <b>Cole Blakeman</b>. I created this site for practice and to share a bit about myself.

        I came to Mizzou to play on the chess team. Originally I had planned to play for Texas Tech or UTD, but when I took a visit I fell in love with the campus and decided to go here instead.
        I'm on a team if 11 players right now and we all live in the Respect Residence Hall. Since I have started college earlier this academic year I have had the best time of my life. The city of Columbia is amazing.
        I am originally from a city called Keller, it is near the DFW Metroplex. Below I have a link to the Keller home website.

            I have been playing chess since first grade. I was trained by an International Master named Keaton Kiewra soon after learning how to play. He helped me a lot with fundamentals but I didn't get into chess
            professionally until I was in 10th grade. Within a year I achieved my Class A Title and my Rated Expert title all while winning the Texas Grade State Championship. After winning state was when I started looking for colleges
            that would help me excel further into become an FIDE Master or International Master. Below is a link to my USCF Ratings History and some of my accomplishments.

            At Mizzou I am currently enrolled in a Dual Major for IT and Business. Many of the chess players here are also in the Business department so it is helpful to have people around me that are studying similair subjects. However, none of them are in IT
            so I'v been a one man show in this subject. To try and improve my programming I merged IT and chess together. The Swiss System is a pairing program that tournament directors use to run events. 
            By downloading the software and learning all it's functions I'v been able to become a certified Tournament Director and learn many new things about computers and programming.
